## Features:

* Configurable per-dimension passive radiation from the environment.
* Configurable simulation of the absorption of environmental radiation by blocks with respect to their hardness.
* Configurable simulation of atmospheric absorption of radiation with configurable start and end heights, allowing for the realistic tapering of radiation received.


## Usage ideas:

* Use in conjunction with a space exploration mod such as Galacticraft or Advanced Rocketry to improve realism and motivate the construction of shielded extraplanetary bases.
* Add to a custom map or alongside a mod that alters biome spawning to create a highly irradiated surface wasteland.
* Make skybases and high-altitude living more hazardous.


## Future Plans:

* Permit radiation level update cycles to differ in length and rate from the configured NuclearCraft radiation updates.
* Add configurable per-block radiation absorption overrides.
* Delay initial onset of radiation, per-player or globally, to create a grace period for players to prepare to burrow.
* Allow for the creation of radiation "cycles" - i.e. a certain number of days at a certain radiation level, another number of days at a different rad level, etc, on repeat.
* Optional radiation spillover from adjacent blocks on the x and z axes to make walls more important.
* Optional radiation checks from every world axis, not just from the sky (Very much a maybe, could be prohibitively performance-heavy).
